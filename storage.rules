# Firebase Storage is NOT used by DeviceSync.
#
# Files transfer directly between devices over the local WiFi network:
#   - Child device runs an HTTP server (NanoHTTPD) serving its sync folder
#   - Parent device connects to the child's IP over LAN and pulls files via OkHttp
#
# Firestore is used ONLY for sync pair configuration (settings backup).
# You can delete this file and disable Firebase Storage in your Firebase project.
